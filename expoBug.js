While developing a React Native app using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual issue where the development server would randomly stop responding or become extremely slow. This wasn't directly related to code errors, but rather seemed to stem from resource exhaustion or internal errors within the Metro bundler. The application would run for a period, sometimes hours, then become unresponsive, requiring a complete restart of the Expo CLI.  Debugging proved difficult as there were no specific error messages in the console. Standard troubleshooting steps like cleaning the cache and restarting the machine yielded no consistent results.
